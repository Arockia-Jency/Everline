# Everline 💖

Everline is a private, secure digital space designed for couples to document their journey together. It serves as a personal vault for "Moments"—combining photos, notes, and moods into a beautiful timeline that stays private and protected.

## ✨ Features

* **Secure Photo Vault:** Store your most precious memories behind a custom app-specific security layer.
* **Mood Tracking:** Tag your moments with moods (Happy, Romantic, Silly, etc.) to see the emotional landscape of your relationship.
* **Smart Timeline:** An organized, searchable feed of your story with advanced filtering options.
* **Privacy First:** Built with a "Vault" mindset, ensuring photos are protected and the app remains a safe space.
* **SwiftData Integration:** High-performance local storage for seamless offline access.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

Everline is built with privacy as its foundation:
* **Custom Authentication:** Uses a dedicated PIN/Password separate from the device passcode.
* **Privacy Overlay:** Automatically blurs app content when switching apps to prevent prying eyes.
* **Local Storage:** All data is stored locally on the device using encrypted containers.

* **Database:** SwiftData (Local Persistence)
* **Language:** Swift 6.0
